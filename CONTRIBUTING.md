Hello everybody! ðŸ’ª

Any contribution to this project is appreciated and welcomed ðŸ˜Ž
Just make sure that you follow these simple rules:

- Create your branch from **test**
- Please, name your branch like: `feat/...` | `fix/...` | `chore/...` [in brief, use the correct prefix to indicate if it is a new feature, some fix or a version upgrade]
- Open a new PR and let's see if what you did works on [PartitelleBotTest](https://t.me/PartitelleTestBot) [as a best practice, the PR title should be like: `feat: ...` | `fix: ...` | `chore: ...`]
- If it works, I bring your contribution to [PartitelleBot](https://t.me/PartitelleBot)

See this [PR example](https://github.com/iamgiolaga/partitelle-bot/pull/20)

Best,
Giovanni
