=================
Architecture
=================

This is a *Python* project relying on `python-telegram-bot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot>`_ library.
Data storage is handled through *PostgreSQL*.
The application and the mentioned database are both hosted on `Render <https://dashboard.render.com>`_.

=================
Project structure
=================
- **database.ini**: a configuration file with database credentials
- **config.py**: a little function to parse and read database credentials in *database.ini*
- **requirements.txt**: a file to indicate Render which external libraries are necessary to the Python code.
- **main.py**: the real heart of PartitelleBot code

By adding **PartitelleBot** to your Telegram group, you can easily manage those so-hard-to-organize weekly football matches with your friends.
You have two ways of interacting with the bot:

1. by writing a specific set of `allowed messages`_ through the conversation
2. by using standard commands_

By default, the bot sets all new matches the next Wednesday at 9 pm but this information is, of course, editable. Once a new match is created through /start command, people can begin to organize the match through the set of allowed messages. The first time the bot detects an adding interaction, it will print a `match summary`_ of the current situation whereas from the second time it will edit its previous message (by the way remind that a new explicit summary can be obtained through /participants command). In this way, people can easily and autonomously add, propose, and remove themselves or each other. Once the target number is reached, users enter the `final phase`_; here, the bot states that is the time to play and asks permission to generate /teams. Through this command, the bot randomly generates two groups of players, respectively the black team and the white team. At this point, users can always adjust the teams by `swapping players`_.

**Note**: if you give PartitelleBot the administrator rights, it will be able to pin its messages in the group.

In my organizational experience, one of the most annoying tasks is to keep on copying and pasting the same list over and over again
each time a new update over participants turns out. This summary aims to change this pattern and let the bot do the dirty work.
This message has a specific structure:

**GIORNO:** <day> | <time>


<participants list from 1 to N

- added player ✅
- added player ✅
- proposed player ❓
- ...
- free slot ❌
where N is the target number>


<description>

**CAMPO:** <pitch>
